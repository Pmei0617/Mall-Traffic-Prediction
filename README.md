# Mall-Traffic-Prediction

Self-guided project using data provided by Digital Marketing Analytics course at Wisconsin School of Business to predict mall traffic. Please see Colab notebook for further details and coding.

**Achieved best model performance out of 15 groups**

## Project Background
Customer traffic is the most relevant KPI for mall managers, and we use it as the outcome variable when evaluating the effectiveness of mall campaigns. Malls lease retail spaces to independent stores, including department stores, brand chain stores, and privately-owned small businesses. The rent that malls collect from tenant stores is determined by factors such as square footage of the rental space, locations of the rental space, and customer traffic to the mall. While square footage and location are usually fixed, customer traffic is a variable factor that malls can take measures to improve. Increases in customer traffic strongly correlate with increases in mall revenue, as indicated by industry reports and as we found in an additional analysis. Unlike department stores that use sales as a main KPI, malls focus on bringing in customers, and it is up to each tenant store to convert shoppers visiting the mall into paying customers. Therefore, increasing customer traffic, which in turn drives up mall revenue, is a key objective of mall managers.

## Methodology
Build ML models to predict 7 key metrics of mall related to traffic:

Daily mall traffic
Total visit
Total traffic of stores in 5 different categories

## File Description
CASE_GROUP_PREDICT_SAMPLE: Used to build and train ML models. File contains all independent variables and the 7 dependent variables.

CASE_GROUP_PREDICT_HOLD_DATA: Used to pass into ML models in order to predict the 7 dependent variables. File constains all independent variables and no dependent variables.
